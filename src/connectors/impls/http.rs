//! The `http` connector provides integration against the HTTP protocol suite.
//!
//! ## Configuration
//!
//! ### Client
//!
//! ```tremor title="config.troy"
//! define connector `http-out` from http_client
//! with
//!   use std::time::nanos;
//!   config = {
//!     # Target URL for this HTTP client
//!     "url": "http://host:80",
//!
//!     # Optional Transport Level Security configuration
//!     # If url schme in `url` is `https` then TLS configuration is required
//!     # "tls": { ... },
//!
//!     # Optional authentication method, can be one of
//!     # * "basic" - basic authentication
//!     #   ```tremor
//!     #      "auth": { "basic": { "username": "snot", "password": "badger" } },
//!     #   ```
//!     # * "gcp"   - Google Cloud Platform
//!     #   ```tremor
//!     #    "auth": "gcp", # See https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started
//!     #  ```
//!     # By default, no authentication is used
//!     # "auth": "none",
//!
//!     # HTTP method - defaults to `POST`, case insensitive
//!     # "method": "get",
//!     
//!     # Concurrency - number of simultaneous in-flight requests ( defaults to 4 )
//!     # "concurrency": 4,
//!
//!     # Request timeout - default is unset ( do not timeout )
//!     # "timeout": nanos::from_secs(10), # nanoseconds
//!
//!     # Optional default HTTP headers
//!     # "headers": { "key": "value", "other-key": ["v1", "v2"] },
//!
//!     # Custom Mime Codec Map, overrides default `codec`
//!     # "mime_mapping": {
//!     #    # key defines the MIME type, value defines codec by name
//!     #    "application/json": "json",
//!     #    "application/yaml": "yaml"
//!     #    "*/*": "json"               # default codec
//!     # }
//!   }
//! end;
//! ```
//!
//! ### Server
//!
//! ```tremor title="config.troy"
//! define connector `http-in` from http_server
//! with
//!   config = {
//!     "url": "http://localhost:8080",
//!
//!     # Optional Transport Level Security configuration
//!     # "tls": { ... },
//!
//!     # Custom Mime Codec Map, overrides default `codec`
//!     # "mime_mapping": {
//!     #    # key defines the MIME type, value defines codec by name
//!     #    "application/json": "json",
//!     #    "application/yaml": "yaml"
//!     #    "*/*": "json"               # default codec
//!     # }
//!   }
//! end;
//! ```
//!
//! ## Codecs
//!
//! The HTTP connectors are somewhast special as they handle the encoding and decoding based on the content-type header not by a single defined codec.
//!
//! By default tremor supplies a  mapping of mime-type to it's codecs as part of the base implementation. However it is possible to overwrite this with the `mime_mapping` option.
//!
//! Once the `mime_mapping` config option is defined it will completely replace the default mappings. To combine the two the `tremor::http::mime_to_codec` constant can be uased as a baseline.
//!
//! For a "default" mapping the entry `*/*` as a mime type can be configured and will be used for any mime type not otherwise defined.
//!
//! ### Example
//!
//! Define a connector that can handle incorrect mime types from the server by overwriting the `application/octet-stream` mime type to use the `csv` codec.
//!
//! ```tremor title="config.troy"
//!  use tremor::http;
//!  use std::record;
//!  define connector `http_in` from http_client
//!   with
//!     preprocessors = ["separate"],
//!     config = {
//!       "url": "https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/open/imports-exports/crude-oil-exports-by-type-monthly.csv",
//!       "method": "get",
//!       "tls": true,
//!       "custom_codecs": record::combine(
//!         # support all the default codecs
//!         http::mime_to_codec,
//!         {
//!           # but use csv for `application/octet-stream`
//!           "application/octet-stream": "csv"
//!           # also use csv for unknown mime types
//!           "*/*": "csv"
//!       })
//!     }
//!   end;
//! ```
//!
//! ## Metadata
//!
//! The `http` connector supports metadata allowing request and response
//! protocol metadata to be inspected, checked, and manipulated in advanced
//! integrations.
//!
//! Metadata allows context information related to the payload data represented as a value in tremor to be decorated with context from
//! connectors and operators to control specific behaviours in a running
//! pipeline.
//!
//! ### Request metadata
//!
//! Request metadata allows the HTTP method, headers and other other request parameters of the HTTP request to be overridden.
//!
//! Request metadata can be set for an event
//!
//! ```tremor
//! let $request = ...
//! ```
//!
//! The request metadata is applied per request, and should be of `record` type and structured as follows:
//!
//! ```tremor
//! {
//!   # Overrides the connector's default method HTTP for this request  
//!   # -  Setting to an illegal HTTP VERB results in an error
//!   "method": "GET",
//!   # Overrides the endpoint, path and parameters for this request
//!   # -  Care should be taken where authentication is use
//!   # -  Setting to a non-http URL results in an error
//!   "url": "https://some_host:8080/foo/bar/baz?a=b",
//!   # Overrides the headers for this request, passing through unchanged default headers from configuration
//!   "headers": { "x-snot": "y-badger", }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! #### Special cases
//!
//! - If a transfer encoding is specified as `chunked` then chunked transfer encoding will be used for the request transfer
//! - If a mime type is set, and custom mime codec mappings are provided the
//!   user supplied matching codec will be applied
//! - If a mime type is set, and no custom mapping matches, then the configured
//!   connector codec will be applied, or the `json` default if none is configured.
//! - If possible the connector will attempt to set an appropriate content type
//! - If authentication is configured, authentication headers will follow the method supplied to the connector
//!
//! ### Response metadata
//!
//! Response metadata allows records the response parameters set against a HTTP request that
//! a response is issued against recording the decisions the `http_server` connector makes
//! when responding to requests.
//!
//! The response can be read from the `$response` metadata.
//!
//! Response metadata takes the following general form:
//!
//! ```tremor
//! {
//!   # The HTTP status code
//!   "status": 200,
//!   # Headers
//!   "headers": { "x-snot": "y-badger", }
//!   # The HTTP protocol version negotiated
//!   "version": "1.1",
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### Correlation metadata
//!
//! Setting the `$correlation` metadata on an outbound request will result in the response
//! being tagged with the `$correlation` value set in the corresponding request.
