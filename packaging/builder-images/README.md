# Builder Images

Docker images meant to be used for compilation across various targets (eg: as part of CI builds during testing of individual commits/PRs, or to produce the final release artifacts). Works well with [cross](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross), but can be used independent of it too.

We publish these images to [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tremorproject/tremor-builder/tags), and they get picked up via [cross configuratio
n](../../Cross.toml) file at project root, during builds (cross automatically pulls them if not already present). So unless you are making changes to the files here, you won't need to build these images locally.

## Modifications

If you are changing any of the files here, you will need to rebuild and push the image:

```bash
# build image for a target
./build_image.sh x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

# or the same, from project root
#make builder-image-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

# push the image (only project owners have the permissions for this)
docker push tremorproject/tremor-builder:x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

To build all the (in-use) images at once, you can use the following make command from project root:

```bash
make builder-images
```

### Rust Version

The images are provisoned with the rust version specified in the project [rust-toolchain](../../rust-toolchain) file, so the above instructions apply for when we bump the versions there too. This can be a point of friction for builds (as the rust version will probably change more frequently than any of the files here). So in the future, we may automate the image updates to keep up with the latest rust releases.
