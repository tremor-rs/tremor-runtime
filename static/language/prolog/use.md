### TREMOR_PATH

The `TREMOR_PATH` environment path variable is a `:` delimited set of paths.

Each path is an absolute or relative path to a directory.

When using relative paths - these are relative to the working directory where the
`tremor` executable is executed from.

The tremor standard library MUST be added to the path to be accessible to scripts.
