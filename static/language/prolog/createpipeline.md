The `CreatePipeline` rule creates a pipeline.

A pipeline is a query operation composed using the query langauge DSL
instead of a builtin operation provided by tremor written in the rust
programming language.

The rule causes an instance of the referenced pipeline definition to be
created an inserted into the query processing execution graph.
