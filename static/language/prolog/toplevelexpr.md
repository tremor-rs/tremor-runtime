The `TopLevelExpr` rule specifies the expression forms that are legal at the
outer most scope of a tremor script definition.

The legal forms are:
* Use declarations - these allow external modules to be referenced.
* Constant expressions - these are immutable compile time constants.
* Function definitions - these are user defined functions.
* Intrinsic function definitions - these are builtin funtions provided by the runtime.
