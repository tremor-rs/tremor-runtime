The `intrinsic` rule defines intrinsic function signatures.

This rule allows tremor maintainers to document the builtin functions implemented as
native rust code. The facility also allows document generation tools to document builtin
intrinsic functions in the same way as user defined functions.

In short, these can be thought of as runtime provided.

For information on how to define user defined functions see the [function](#rule-fndecl) rule.
