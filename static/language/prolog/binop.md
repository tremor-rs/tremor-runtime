The `BinOp` rule is a [LALRPOP](http://lalrpop.github.io/lalrpop/) convenience that allows defining
a [macro rule](http://lalrpop.github.io/lalrpop/tutorial/006_macros.html) template for a common 
sub rule sequence.

The `BinOp` macro rule definition in tremor DSLs allows binary operations to be defined tersely

|Argument|Description|
|---|---|
|Current|The current rule permissible for the LHS of the expression|
|Operation|The operation to be performeed|
|Next|The current rule permissible for the RHS of the expression|

The macro imposes rule precedence where the left hand side expression takes
higher precedence relative to the right hand side expression when interpreted
by tremor.

### Considerations

Tremor performs compile time optimizations such as constant folding. So literal expressions
of the form `1 + 2` may compile to a constant ( `3` in this case ) and have no runtime cost.
