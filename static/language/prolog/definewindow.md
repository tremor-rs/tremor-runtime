The `DefineWindow` rule defines a temporal window specification.

A window is a mechanism that caches, stores or buffers events for processing
over a finite temporal range. The time range can be based on the number of
events, the wall clock or other defined parameters.

The named window can be instanciated via operations that support windows such
as the `select` operation.
