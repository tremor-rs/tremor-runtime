The `RecordPattern` defines structural patterns against record values.

Record patterns start with the `%{` operator and end with '}'.

Patterns may be empty `%{}`, or a sequence of record pattern fields.

Record patterns are search oriented based on predicate matching.

Ordinal, order or position based matching in records is not defined.
