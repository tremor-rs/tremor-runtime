The `MetaPath` rule defines path operations for event metadata references.

In the context of a streaming event, allows metadata generated by the runtime
to be accessed via path operations.

It is also possible to write to metadata to hint at the runtime to perform
certain functions on the event data being forwarded. Tremor operators and
connectors can read and write metadata.
