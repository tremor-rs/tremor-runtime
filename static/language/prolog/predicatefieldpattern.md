The `PredicateFieldPattern` rule defines the legal predicate tests available
within record patterns.

Record patterns can use:
* Extractor test expressions against fields.
* Record, array and tuple patterns against fields.
* Equality and comparison predicate patterns against fields.
* Presence patterns against fields.
