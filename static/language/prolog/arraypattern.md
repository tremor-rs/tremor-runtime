The `ArrayPattern` defines structural patterns against array values.

Array patterns start with the `%[` operator and end with `]`.

Patterns may be empty `%[]`, or a sequence of array predicate patterns.

Array patterns are search oriented based on predicate matching.

Where ordinal matching is needed then a `TuplePattern` may be preferential.
