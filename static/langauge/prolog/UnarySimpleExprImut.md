The `UnarySimpleExprImut` rule specifies predicate unary expression operations.

Expressions can be marked explicitly with `not` or `!` to negate the target simple presence expression.

Otherwise, the expression reduces to a simple presence expression.

The simple presence expression has lower precedence.
