        Given a valid artefact kind parameter of:

        * pipeline
        * onramp
        * offramp
        * binding

        Given a valid artefact identifier of an artefact stored in the tremor artefact repository

        Given a valid instance identifier for a deployed and running instance of the artefact deployed
        and accesible via the tremor instance registry

        Deactivates, stops and unpublishes the target instances and any
        dependant instances that are no longer referenced by the runtime.

        Returns old instance data, on success.
