# 'in', 'out' and 'err' streams are builtin
# events flow from the 'in' stream through its default 'out' port
# events ' flow to the 'out' stream through its default 'in' port
# events' flow to the 'out' stream through its default 'in' port
select event from in/out into out/in;

# where default inbound and outbound ports are used ( frequent )
# the port does not need to be specified
# in/out is equivalent to in
