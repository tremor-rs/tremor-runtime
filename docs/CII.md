Met.

## Reporting

### Bug-reporting process

__The project MUST provide a process for users to submit bug reports (e.g., using an issue tracker or a mailing list). (URL required)__

Met.

__It is SUGGESTED that common tools be used for building the software.__

Met.

__The project SHOULD be buildable using only FLOSS tools.__

Met. The project primarily uses FLOSS tooling with the exception of EQC which we used for random stochastic property based testing.

### Automated test suite

__The project MUST use at least one automated test suite that is publicly released as FLOSS (this test suite may be maintained as a separate FLOSS project).__

Met. https://github.com/wayfair-incubator/tremor-runtime/actions

__A test suite SHOULD be invocable in a standard way for that language.__

Met. https://github.com/wayfair-incubator/tremor-runtime/tree/master/docs/development/process/running-tests.md

__It is SUGGESTED that the test suite cover most (or ideally all) the code branches, input fields, and functionality.__

Met. The project uses a combination of unit, functional, benchmark, integration and specialized ( EQC ) tests

__It is SUGGESTED that the project implement continuous integration (where new or changed code is frequently integrated into a central code repository and automated tests are run on the result).__

Met. https://github.com/wayfair-incubator/tremor-runtime/actions and TBD-eqc-runner-public-url

### New functionality testing

__The project MUST have a general policy (formal or not) that as major new functionality is added to the software produced by the project, tests of that functionality should be added to an automated test suite.__

Met. https://github.com/wayfair-incubator/tremor-runtime/tree/master/docs/development/process/rfp.md

__The project MUST have evidence that the test policy for adding tests has been adhered to in the most recent major changes to the software produced by the project.__

Met.

__It is SUGGESTED that this policy on adding tests (see test policy) be documented in the instructions for change proposals.__

Met.

### Warning flags

__The project MUST enable one or more compiler warning flags, a "safe" language mode, or use a separate "linter" tool to look for code quality errors or common simple mistakes, if there is at least one FLOSS tool that can implement this criterion in the selected language.__

Met. The project enables all warnings and enforces strict / pendantic checks on code style, format. These are constraints and limitations are enforced by the build and continuous integration systems.

__The project MUST address warnings.__

Met.

__It is SUGGESTED that projects be maximally strict with warnings in the software produced by the project, where practical.__

Met.

### Security

__The project MUST have at least one primary developer who knows how to design secure software. (See ‘details’ for the exact requirements.)__

Met.

__At least one of the project's primary developers MUST know of common kinds of errors that lead to vulnerabilities in this kind of software, as well as at least one method to counter or mitigate each of them.__

Met.

### Use basic good cryptographic practices

__The software produced by the project MUST use, by default, only cryptographic protocols and algorithms that are publicly published and reviewed by experts (if cryptographic protocols and algorithms are used).__

Met. The project does not provide bespoke cryptographic protocols, algorithms or methods of its own. The project calls on specifically designed externally provided cryptographic methods.

__If the software produced by the project is an application or library, and its primary purpose is not to implement cryptography, then it SHOULD only call on software specifically designed to implement cryptographic functions; it SHOULD NOT re-implement its own.__

Met. The project does not provide bespoke cryptographic protocols, algorithms or methods of its own. The project calls o specifically designed externally provided cryptographic methods.

__All functionality in the software produced by the project that depends on cryptography MUST be implementable using FLOSS.__

Met.

__The security mechanisms within the software produced by the project MUST use default keylengths that at least meet the NIST minimum requirements through the year 2030 (as stated in 2012). It MUST be possible to configure the software so that smaller keylengths are completely disabled.__

Met.

__The default security mechanisms within the software produced by the project MUST NOT depend on broken cryptographic algorithms (e.g., MD4, MD5, single DES, RC4, Dual_EC_DRBG), or use cipher modes that are inappropriate to the context, unless they are necessary to implement an interoperable protocol (where the protocol implemented is the most recent version of that standard broadly supported by the network ecosystem, that ecosystem requires the use of such an algorithm or mode, and that ecosystem does not offer any more secure alternative). The documentation MUST describe any relevant security risks and any known mitigations if these broken algorithms or modes are necessary for an interoperable protocol.__

Met.

__The security mechanisms within the software produced by the project SHOULD implement perfect forward secrecy for key agreement protocols so a session key derived from a set of long-term keys cannot be compromised if one of the long-term keys is compromised in the future.__

Met.

__If the software produced by the project causes the storing of passwords for authentication of external users, the passwords MUST be stored as iterated hashes with a per-user salt by using a key stretching (iterated) algorithm (e.g., PBKDF2, Bcrypt or Scrypt).__

Met.

__The security mechanisms within the software produced by the project MUST generate all cryptographic keys and nonces using a cryptographically secure random number generator, and MUST NOT do so using generators that are cryptographically insecure.__

### Secured delivery against min-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks

__The project MUST use a delivery mechanism that counters MITM attacks. Using https or ssh+scp is acceptable.__

Met.

__A cryptographic hash (e.g., a sha1sum) MUST NOT be retrieved over http and used without checking for a cryptographic signature.__

Met.

### Publicly known vulnerabilities fixed

__There MUST be no unpatched vulnerabilities of medium or higher severity that have been publicly known for more than 60 days.__

Met.

__Projects SHOULD fix all critical vulnerabilities rapidly after they are reported.__

Met.

### Other security issues

__The public repositories MUST NOT leak a valid private credential (e.g., a working password or private key) that is intended to limit public access.__

Met.

## Analysis

### Static code analysis

__At least one static code analysis tool (beyond compiler warnings and "safe" language modes) MUST be applied to any proposed major production release of the software before its release, if there is at least one FLOSS tool that implements this criterion in the selected language.__

Met.

__It is SUGGESTED that at least one of the static analysis tools used for the static_analysis criterion include rules or approaches to look for common vulnerabilities in the analyzed language or environment.__

Met.

__All medium and higher severity exploitable vulnerabilities discovered with static code analysis MUST be fixed in a timely way after they are confirmed.__

Met.

__It is SUGGESTED that static source code analysis occur on every commit or at least daily.__

Met.

### Dynamic code analysis

__It is SUGGESTED that at least one dynamic analysis tool be applied to any proposed major production release of the software before its release.__

Met.

__It is SUGGESTED that if the software produced by the project includes software written using a memory-unsafe language (e.g., C or C++), then at least one dynamic tool (e.g., a fuzzer or web application scanner) be routinely used in combination with a mechanism to detect memory safety problems such as buffer overwrites. If the project does not produce software written in a memory-unsafe language, choose "not applicable" (N/A).__

Met.

__It is SUGGESTED that the software produced by the project include many run-time assertions that are checked during dynamic analysis.__

Met.

__All medium and higher severity exploitable vulnerabilities discovered with dynamic code analysis MUST be fixed in a timely way after they are confirmed.__

Met.
