# Dissect

The Dissect extractor is loosely based on logstash's dissect plugin. It extracts data from strings in form of key-value pairs based on the pattern specified. It supports simple patterns which makes it lightweight compared to other extractors such as grok or regex.

Tokens are enclosed within `%{ }` and any characters placed between tokens is considered as a delimiter. There should  be at least one delimiter in between 2 tokens except if one of them is a padding token.

## Predicate

When used as a predicate test with `~`, it passes if and only if the referent target matches the pattern exhaustively.

## Extraction

If the predicate passes, then a record of matched entries are returned where the keys are the fields specified in the pattern, and the values are the values extracted from the input string.

## Patterns

The pattern can contain any of the following types:

| Name           | Syntax                  | Description                                                  | Sample Pattern                  | Input         | Output                                    | Notes                                                        |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Simple         | `%{ field }`            | Given field is used as the key for the pattern extracted     | `%{name}`                       | John          | `"name"  : "John"`                        |                                                              |
| Append         | `% { + field }`         | Appends the value to another field specified with the same field name. | `% {+name} %{+name}`            | John Doe      | `"name" : "John Doe"`                     | `+` symbol on the first token is optional<br />Does not support types |
| Named keys     | `%{& field}`            | Returns key value pair of the field. Takes the key from the previously matched field. | `%{ code }  % {country}`        | DE Germany    | `"DE" : "Germany"`                       | Needs a field present earlier with the same name             |
| Empty field    | `% { field }`           | Will return an empty value if no data is present             | `%{ code }     %{country}`      | Germany       | `"code" : "",<br />"country" : "Germany"` |                                                              |
| Skipped fields | `%{? field}`            | Skips the extracted value                                    | `%{ ? first_name}  {last_name}` | John Doe      | `"name" : "Doe"`                          |                                                              |
| Typed Values   | `% { field : type}`     | Extracts the value from the data and converts it to another type specified | `%{age : int}`                  | 22            | `"age" : 22`                              | Supported Types: int, float                                  |
| Padding        | `%{_}` or `%{_(chars)}` | `Removes padding from the field in the output`               | `%{name} %{_} %{age}`           | John       22 | `"name" : "John", "age":"22"`             | The field being extracted may not contain the padding.<br />A custom padding can be specified by using the `%{_(custom)}` notation |

The operation can error in the following cases:

* There is no delimiter between 2 tokens.
* Skipped, Append or Named field with no name (e.g. `%{?}`).
* A delimiter specified in the pattern is missing.
* A named field is not found in the pattern.
* Invalid type specified.
* Types used with the append token.
* Pattern isn't completely parsed (at end of input).
* Input isn't completely parsed.

Examples:

```tremor
match { "test": "http://example.com/"} of
  case foo = %{test ~= dissect|%{protocol}://%{host}.%{.tld} | } => foo
  default => "ko"
end;
```

Will output:

```bash
"test": {
    "protocol": "http",
    "host": "example",
    ".tld": "com/"
}
```

```tremor
match { "test": "2019-04-20------------------- high 3 foo bar" } of
  case foo = %{test ~= dissect|%{date}%{_(-)} %{?priority} %{&priority} %{+snot} %{+snot}| } => foo
  default => "ko"
end;
```

Will output:

```bash
{
   "test": {
     "date": "2019-04-20",
     "high": "3",
     "snot": "foo bar"
   }
```
