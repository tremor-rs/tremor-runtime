//! ## `gcs_streamer`
//!
//! This connector provides the ability to stream events into Google Cloud Storage.
//!
//! :::note
//!    Authentication happens over the [GCP autentication](./index.md#GCP)
//! :::
//!
//! For this connector, while the (name, bucket name) pair does not change, the consecutive events will be appended to the same gcs object.
//!
//! ### Modes of operation
//!
//! All our object storage connectors that do uploads ([`s3_streamer`] and `gcs_streamer`) operate with the same two modes.
//!
//! #### `yolo`
//!
//! The `yolo` mode is going to report every event as successfully delivered if uploading it to gcs worked or not.
//! This mode is intended for "fire-and-forget" use-cases, where it is not important if a single event in the middle of an upload failed or is missing.
//! The upload will continue nonetheless and only be finished when a new event with another bucket or name is received.
//!
//! This mode is well-suited for e.g. aggregating time-series events into gcs object by time unit (e.g. hour or day) where it is not too important that the resulting gcs object is 1:1 mirroring of all the events in the correct order without gaps.
//!
//! #### `consistent`
//!
//! `consistent` mode, on the other hand, is well suited when uploading consistent and correct gcs objects is important. In this mode, the `gcs_streamer` will fail a complete upload whenever only 1 single event could not be successfully uploaded to gcs. This guarantees that only complete and consistent gcs objects will show up in your buckets. But due to this logic, it is possible to lose events and whole uploads if the upstream connectors don't replay failed events. The [`wal` connector](./wal.md) and the [`kafka_consumer`](./kafka.md#consumer) can replay events, so it makes sense to pair the `gcs_streamer` in `consistent` mode with those.
//!
//! This mode guarantees that only complete gcs objects with all events in the right order are uploaded to gcs, object where uploading failed for some reason will be deleted, expecting the upstream to retry the upload. It is well-suited for uploading complete files, like images or documents.
//!
//! ### Metadata
//! Two metadata fields are required for the connector to work - `$gcs_streamer.name` (will be used as the object name) and `$gcs_streamer.bucket` (the name of the bucket where the object will be placed).
//!
//! ### Configuration
//!
//! All of the configuration options,, aside of token, are optional.
//!
//! | name                | description                                                                                            | default                                               |
//! |---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
//! | `url`               | The HTTP(s) endpoint to which the requests will be made                                                | `"https://storage.googleapis.com/upload/storage/v1"`  |
//! | `bucket`            | The optional bucket to stream events into if not overwritten by event metadata `$gcs_streamer.bucket`  |                                                       |
//! | `mode`              | The mode of operation for this connector. See [Modes of operation](#modes-of-operation).               |                                                       |
//! | `connect_timeout`   | The timeout for the connection (in nanoseconds)                                                        | `10_000_000_000` (10 seconds)                         |
//! | `buffer_size`       | The size of a single request body, in bytes (must be divisible by 256kiB, as required by Google)       | `8388608` (8MiB, the minimum recommended by Google)   |
//! | `max_retries`       | The number of retries to perform for a failed request to GCS.                                          | `3`                                                   |
//! | `backoff_base_time` | Base waiting time in nanoseconds for exponential backoff when doing retries of failed requests to GCS. | `25_000_000` (25 ms)                                  |
//! | `token`             | The authentication token see [GCP autentication](./index.md#GCP)                                       |                                                       |
