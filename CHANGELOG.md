### Breaking Changes

- the `tremor api` sub command in the cli has been removed.
- the `-` is no longer a valid part of identifiers.
- binaries now use `_` to sepoerate type names as `-` is no longer a identifier.
- changed naming for `record` object to avoid keywords like `select` and `merge`. New names are `record.extract` and `record.combine`.
- command separators are now unified, both `patch`, `match` and `for` now use `;` the same way the rest of the language does
- in all definitional statements `args` now specifies interface arguments that are overwritable in the correspanding `create` statement, while `with` specifies non-overwritable configuration in both `define` and `create` statements - this unifies the use of `with`  and `args` between trickle and troy
- file connector no longer splits by lines - it now requires a preconnector
- define for both troy and trickle now follow the same principle of `define <type> <alias> from <source>`
- `wal` is no longer an operator but a connector
- for the elastic connector indexes have not to be set on the batch not the individual event so one batch can only be to a single index.
- metronome interval is now in nanoseconds (as all other timings)
- Most connectors require a specified codec now instead of using JSON as a default
- `merge` no longer treats `null` in the spec as a delete option but rather as a normal value
- Combine all compression and decompression pre/postprocessors.
