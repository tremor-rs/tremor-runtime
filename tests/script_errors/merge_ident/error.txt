Error: 
    1 | let merge = event;
      |     ^^^^^ Found the token `merge` but expected one of `$`, `(`, `<ident>`, `[`, `args`, `event`, `group`, `state`, `window`, `{`
      |           NOTE: It looks like you tried to use 'merge' as an ident, consider quoting it as `merge` to make it an identifier.
