Error: 
    1 | let select = event;
      |     ^^^^^^ Found the token `select` but expected one of `$`, `(`, `<ident>`, `[`, `args`, `event`, `group`, `state`, `window`, `{`
      |            NOTE: It looks like you tried to use 'select' as an ident, consider quoting it as `select` to make it an identifier.
