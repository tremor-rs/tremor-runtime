Error:

      |                         ^^^^^^^^^^ References to `event` or `$` are not allowed in this context
      |                                    NOTE: Here you operate in the whole window, not a single event. You need to wrap this reference in an aggregate function (e.g. aggr::win::last(...)) or use it in the group by clause of this query.
