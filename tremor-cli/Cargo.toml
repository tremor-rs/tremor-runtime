#
# We use *empty* feature dependencies so that we can switch allocators
# via feature flags. We *require* no default features so that that mechanism
# in src/alloc.rs works effectively in practice.
#
# It is an error to configure defaults in tremor.cli at this time until rust
# allows switching allocators at compile time - this is currently not well
# supported via the global_allocator attribute nor via cfg attributes that
# levarage features
