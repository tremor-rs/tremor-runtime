### The `test` module is used for writing tremor unit tests.

## Runs an assertion for a test, ensures that `expected` and `got` are the
## same. If not errors.
##
## **WARNING**: Do not run assertions in production code!
##  
## > ```tremor
## > assert("one equals one", 1, 1) == true; # suces
## > assert("one equals one", 1, 2); # errors
## > ```
##
## Returns a `bool`.
intrinsic fn assert(name, expected, got) as test::assert;

## The `suite` function is an entrypoint into tremor's
## integrated unit testing framework
##
fn suite(...) with
  null # Nothing to do
end;
