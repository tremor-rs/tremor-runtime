### The base64 module contains functions work with base64 encoding and decoding

## Encodes a `binary` as a base64 encoded string
##
## Returns a `string`
intrinsic fn encode(input) as base64::encode;

## Decodes a base64 ebcided `string` into it's bytes
##
## Returns a `binary`
intrinsic fn decode(input) as base64::decode;
