### This module is a mapping of the `AggregationTemporality` field in
### `CNCF OpenTelemetry` trace spans. The text of the specification has
### been copied into this mapping for convenience.
###
### Where text from the `CNCF OpenTelemetry` specification is used it is
### provided in block quotes.
###
### From the specification:
###
### > `AggregationTemporality` defines how a metric aggregator reports aggregated
### > values. It describes how those values relate to the time interval over
### > which they are aggregated.

## The default `AggregationTemparality` - it must not be used
## conforming implementation will set the temporality to one
## of the valid enumeration values.
##
const unspecified = 0;

## > `DELTA` is an `AggregationTemporality` for a metric aggregator which reports
## > changes since last report time. Successive metrics contain aggregation of
## > values from continuous and non-overlapping intervals.
##
## > The values for a `DELTA` metric are based only on the time interval
## > associated with one measurement cycle. There is no dependency on
## > previous measurements like is the case for `CUMULATIVE` metrics.
##
## > For example, consider a system measuring the number of requests that
## > it receives and reports the sum of these requests every second as a
## > `DELTA` metric:
##
## >   1. The system starts receiving at time=t_0.
## >   2. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.
## >   3. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.
## >   4. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.
## >   5. The 1 second collection cycle ends. A metric is exported for the
## >      number of requests received over the interval of time t_0 to
## >      t_0+1 with a value of 3.
## >   6. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.
## >   7. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.
## >   8. The 1 second collection cycle ends. A metric is exported for the
## >      number of requests received over the interval of time t_0+1 to
## >      t_0+2 with a value of 2.

const delta = 1;

## >  `CUMULATIVE` is an AggregationTemporality for a metric aggregator which
## >  reports changes since a fixed start time. This means that current values
## >  of a `CUMULATIVE` metric depend on all previous measurements since the
## >  start time. Because of this, the sender is required to retain this state
## >  in some form. If this state is lost or invalidated, the `CUMULATIVE` metric
## >  values MUST be reset and a new fixed start time following the last
## >  reported measurement time sent MUST be used.

## >       t_0+2 with a value of 5.
## >    9. The system experiences a fault and loses state.
## >    10. The system recovers and resumes receiving at time=t_1.
## >    11. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.
## >    12. The 1 second collection cycle ends. A metric is exported for the
## >       number of requests received over the interval of time t_1 to
## >       t_0+1 with a value of 1.
##
## >  Note: Even though, when reporting changes since last report time, using
## >  `CUMULATIVE` is valid, it is not recommended. This may cause problems for
## >  systems that do not use start_time to determine when the aggregation
## >  value was reset (e.g. Prometheus).
